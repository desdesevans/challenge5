      I always had thoughts of having children and always said that I wanted to have them, but with life I never knew where they would fit into my busy life. The thought and phrase were always there, but the reality of having a child I couldn’t fathom. I have always worked a full-time job and I have been in school almost my entire life, when would be a good time to start having children? I don’t think there is a “good” time to have a child, because no matter what there is always going to be something that happens that makes that idea seem far-fetched. Here I am currently 30 weeks pregnant with my first child and still in shock, I think shock may be an understatement. I was not planning on having a child; however, I will be having one in less that 3 months. My first thought when I found out the news was how am I going to manage working, school, and a newborn. But since then, I have grown to be excited about my new bundle of joy and cannot wait to meet her. I found a way to schedule my classes around her birth, worked out a way to make my work schedule work around her, and I have been planning how I want her schedule to go once she arrives. It sounds easier than it probably actually is, but I’m optimistic about this new journey of motherhood. I was very hard on myself in the beginning because I felt as if I had made a mistake with my life that I would not be able to come back from. But somehow the little human growing inside has reassured me everything is going to be okay, and she is going to be one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I now have a best friend for life and someone that makes all the hard work I have been doing worth it. I now have something to work for and live for all in one. There may not be a “perfect” time to start having children when the thought of them arises, but the perfect time is created when you find out that you’re are expecting.
